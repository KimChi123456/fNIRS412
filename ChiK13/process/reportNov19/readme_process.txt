- 1st column: raw HbO concentration of 7channels
- 2nd column: Band pass filtered result of 7channels 
with cut off band [0.01 0.5]Hz
- 3rd column: PCA filter (2components-nSV=2) combined with Bpf

Comment:
- Bpf: remove high frequency noises
- PCA: remove motion artifact by defining number of components to be removed
- The signals are not smooth after being filtered
